## Description 

[Completed Password Generator: ](https://spectrekilo.github.io/pwGenerator/)

I was given starter code and was tasked with building a password generator using Javascript. I had to implement and apply javascript functions and methods. I had to create prompts to ask the user what types of characters they wanted in their password. The characters offered were lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Once the user selected which characters were included in the password a for loop function would generate a password based on the characters selected and the desired length of the password.
